# Machine Learning Application

This repository contains my own devlopmend of various Machine Learning algorithms, devloped from coursework as well out of own interest. Some of the algorithms developed were built on base code while some use libraries like Tensorflow.

## Prerequisites

The algorithms are designed in Python3 in Conda. Libraries and frameworks required include

```
Numpy
```
```
Pandas
```
```
sklearn
```
```
scipy
```
```
Tensorflow
```
```
matplotlib
```

## Algorithms Developed

The algroithms developed so far include

### Gaussian Disciminators and Linear Regression

 - It included Discriminant Analysis - linear and quadratic. Linear Regression. Ridge Regression with and without Gradient Descent and Non-Linear Regression
 - Run Script.py to test the implementation
 - Read report.pdf analysis of the model using MNIST and pickle datasets.

```
python3 script.py
```

###  Neural Network

 - Implemented single and multilayer perceptron neural networks without using any external libraries
 - A basic Convolutional Neural Network is designed using Tensorflow
 - Details analysis of the model is done using MNIST and pickle datasets

NOTE: Only cnnScript require Tensorflow

###  SVM and Logisitic Regression

- Logistic Regression Algorithm is developed from the scratch
- SVM is developed using sklearn
